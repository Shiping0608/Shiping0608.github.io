Welcome! I am **Shiping Zhou**. Starting from August 2024, I will be a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering ([CMSE](https://cmse.msu.edu)), under the supervision of [Dr. Andrew Christlieb](https://directory.natsci.msu.edu/Directory/Profiles/Person/101537), at Michigan State University ([MSU](https://msu.edu/)).



Before joining MSU, I received my Ph.D. in the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.mst.edu/) at [Missouri University of Science and Technology](https://www.mst.edu/) in May 2024, under the guidance of [Dr. Yanzhi Zhang](https://web.mst.edu/~zhangyanz/).



My research primarily centers on two main areas:

1. **Nonlocal problems**: This encompasses the development of accurate and efficient numerical schemes for solving nonlocal problems. Applications of these models including various fields such as wave propagation in heterogeneous media in geophysics, anomalous diffusion in biology, and dark matter in cosmology. 
2. **Data-driven modeling**: In this area, I utilize neural network techniques to solve time-dependent classical and nonlocal PDEs. I explore using machine learning to learn the nonlocal kernels and their applications in material science.
