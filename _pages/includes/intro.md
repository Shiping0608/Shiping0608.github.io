Welcome! I am a graduate student in the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.mst.edu/).



My research focuses on the modeling and simulation of nonlocal models. Including apply finite difference methods and spectral methods for solving nonlocal PDEs. Recently, we're working on data-driven modeling for solving time-dependent nonlocal PDEs.
