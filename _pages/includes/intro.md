Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student majoring in **Computational and Applied Mathematics** in the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.mst.edu/) at [Missouri University of Science and Technology](https://www.mst.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Yanzhi Zhang](https://web.mst.edu/~zhangyanz/), and will be graduating in May 2024.



My research primarily centers on two main areas:

1. **Nonlocal problems**: This encompasses the development of accurate and efficient numerical schemes for solving nonlocal problems. Applications of these models including various fields such as geophysics, science, and materials.
2. **Data-driven modeling**: In this area, I explore the applications of neural network techniques to address forward problems that are challenging for traditional methods. Additionally, I employ surrogate models to tackle inverse problems effectively.
